  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>May 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Precision Interpreter (“we,” “us,” “our”) provides a mobile app that translates
    speech and photos between languages. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
    use, and protect your information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice recordings:</strong> When you tap a flag to record, your audio is uploaded to our server for transcription and translation.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> When you take a picture (e.g. of a menu), that image is sent to our OCR/translation service.</li>
    <li><strong>Translation text:</strong> The original and translated text are stored locally on your device and in your user history for replay, but not shared beyond your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage metadata:</strong> Timestamps and language‐pair choices, to power your translation history view.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide real‐time transcription and translation services.</li>
    <li>To display your translation history so you can review or copy past translations.</li>
    <li>To enforce quotas and billing (if you purchase subscription or top-up packs).</li>
    <li>To improve our service (aggregate, anonymized usage analytics only).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal data.  
    Your audio and photos are sent only to our servers and the third‐party transcription/OCR APIs (e.g., Whisper, OCR service) strictly to generate translations.  
    We retain transcripts for your history feature, but do not share them with advertisers or other users.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use industry‐standard TLS encryption for all data in transit.  
    Your recordings and images are stored securely and deleted automatically after 30 days.  
    You can clear your history at any time from the app’s History screen.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not directed to children under 13.  
    We do not knowingly collect data from users under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your translation history in the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Use the “Clear History” button in the History screen to remove all saved entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Email us at <a href="mailto:nativospeaks@gmail.com"</a> for any requests or questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time.  
    The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect significant changes.
